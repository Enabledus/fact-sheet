### Immigration
- [Migrants and Crime in Sweden in the Twenty-First Century](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12115-019-00436-8)
> In 2018, Uppdrag Granskning, a TV-program broadcasted on Swedish state television, surveyed every individual registered for rape or attempted rape between 2012 and 2017. 58% were foreign-born. Among the remaining 42% born in Sweden, some had a migrant background as children to foreign-born, but their exact proportion was not presented. Among those registered for attempted, and completed sexual assault, where victim and criminal were strangers, a good 80% were foreign-born.
Another survey conducted in 2018 by the newspaper Aftonbladet studied 112 individuals registered for group rape (at least two offenders) since 2012. Among them, 73% were foreign-born. In case those born in Sweden with two migrant parents were added, 88% were foreign-born.
In 2017, the newspaper Expressen did a survey of 192 individuals in Stockholm, who, according to police files, were either members of criminal gangs, or had links to criminal networks (as a result of court sentences or preliminary investigations). 82% were migrants, defined as being foreign-born or having two foreign-born parents. In case those with one foreign-born parent was added, the figure rose to 95%.
Yet another set of data was assembled in 2017 by Dagens Nyheter. The material consisted of 100 criminals registered or suspected in investigations on gunfire on public places between 2013 and 2017. 90 of them (90%) had one or two foreign-born parents. Among them, about every second had arrived in Sweden when they were young, while the rest were born in Sweden.

> We reviewed all convictions (n = 21) based on court documents from the District Court, the Court of Appeal and information from the Swedish Tax Agency in Malmö, Sweden, between 2013 and 2018. The findings indicated that the most common offender characteristics were a single status, mean age of 33 years and foreign background.

### Masks
- [N95 filtering facepiece respirators may not achieve the expected protection level against bacteria and viruses.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18326870/)
- [The use of N95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32167245/)
- [The rates of all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4420971/)
> Hospital wards were randomised to: medical masks, cloth masks or a control group (usual practice, which included mask wearing). Participants used the mask on every shift for 4 consecutive weeks.
>> The rates of all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm, with the rate of ILI statistically. Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.
- [Unmasking the surgeons: the evidence base behind the use of facemasks in surgery](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0141076815583167)
> However, overall there is a lack of substantial evidence to support claims that facemasks protect either patient or surgeon from infectious contamination.
- [Respiratory performance offered by N95 respirators and surgical masks](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18326870/)
> The study indicates that N95 filtering facepiece respirators may not achieve the expected protection level against bacteria and viruses. An exhalation valve on the N95 respirator does not affect the respiratory protection; it appears to be an appropriate alternative to reduce the breathing resistance. 
- [Surgical mask filter and fit performance](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18455048/)
> None of these surgical masks exhibited adequate filter performance and facial fit characteristics to be considered respiratory protection devices. 
- [N95 Respirators vs Medical Masks for Preventing Influenza Among Health Care Personnel: A Randomized Clinical Trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31479137/)
> Among outpatient health care personnel, N95 respirators vs medical masks as worn by participants in this trial resulted in no significant difference in the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza. 
- [Effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza: A systematic review and meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32167245/)

- [Do trans- kids stay trans- when they grow up? ](http://www.sexologytoday.org/2016/01/do-trans-kids-stay-trans-when-they-grow_99.html)

- [Psychosexual outcome of gender-dysphoric children](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18981931/)
>  At follow-up, 30% of the 77 participants (19 boys and 4 girls) did not respond to our recruiting letter or were not traceable; 27% (12 boys and 9 girls) were still gender dysphoric (persistence group), and **43% (desistance group: 28 boys and 5 girls) were no longer gender dysphoric**.
>> Twenty-one participants (27%; 9 girls and 12 boys) were still gender dysphoric at follow-up (persistence group). All of thesepersisters had met the complete diagnostic criteria for GID [**according to the DSM-IV10 or the DSM-IV-TR11 at follow-up**](https://books.google.se/books?id=atfTHGjjVeIC&pg=PA38#v=onepage&q&f=false) and had applied for sex reassignment at the Gender Identity Clinicbefore the age of 16.
>>> Twenty-three participants (30%; 19 boys, 4 girls) were visitedat home because they had no longer been seen at the clinic afterchildhood (desistance group). Ten participants (13%) did not want to participate themselves, but they allowed their parents to fill out a questionnaire. This parent group consisted of 9 boys and 1 girl.
>>>> **Results: Persistence (n = 21), Desistance (n = 23), Nonresponders (n = 23)** _(47.73% Persisted)_
- [A Follow-Up Study of Girls With Gender Identity Disorder](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5657572_A_Follow-Up_Study_of_Girls_With_Gender_Identity_Disorder)
> At follow-up, **3 participants (12%)** were judged to have GID or gender dysphoria, and **40% were subthreshold for the diagnosis**.
>> In answering these questions, **22 participants (88%)** reported no distress with their female gender identity at follow-up
>>> On the basis of this information, **2 of the participants met DSM–IV–TR criteria for GID**. Although the other participant did not meet full criteria for GID, information  from  the clinical interview and semi structured GID interview indicated that she was gender dysphoric at follow-up.
- [A Follow-Up Study Of Boys With GID](https://images.nymag.com/images/2/daily/2016/01/SINGH-DISSERTATION.pdf)
> The present study found that the majority of boys with GID showed desistence of their gender dysphoria when followed into adolescence and adulthood: 87.8% of the boys did
>>> **criteria applicable at the time of assessment. A total of _88 (63.3%) boys met complete DSM criteria for GID in childhood._** The remaining 51 (36.7%) boys were subthreshold for a DSM diagnosis, but all had some indicators of GID, and, based on the historical information provided during the assessment, some would have met the complete DSM criteria at some point in their lives prior to their assessment in childhood.

- [A majority of Muslims disagree that homosexuality should be legal in Britain](https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/publication/documents/2018-03/a-review-of-survey-research-on-muslims-in-great-britain-ipsos-mori_0.pdf)
